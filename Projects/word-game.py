Once upon a time, in a far away land, there was a little
boy named {name}. He lived with his mother in a {place}. 
{name} and his mother were very poor and they
had to sell their {animal1}, {name2}, to buy {thing1}. {name} was very
{adjective1}. He loved {name2} very much. The next day, {name}'s
mother sent him to the market to sell {name2}. On the way,
{name} met a man who offered to buy {name2} for {thing2}. 
{name} was very happy and he took the {thing2}. When
{name}'s mother found out, she was very {adjective2} and she threw
the {thing2} out of the window. The next morning, {name} and
his mother woke up and saw a huge {thing3}. {name} was
very excited and he climbed the {thing3}. At the top,
{name} found a {building} and he went inside. There, he found
a {occupation} and a {animal2} that laid {thing_plural}. {name} stole the
{animal2} and ran down the {thing3}. The {occupation} followed him
but {name} cut the {thing3} and the {occupation} fell and died.
{name} and his mother were very {adjective3} and they lived
happily ever after.
